- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

I overloaded the Library constructor with an option to include the boolean for whether there's an elevator or not to include that in the input. This way, if it was not specified, we assumed that the library had an elevator. I did this because I'm operating in a world where elevator access is assumed. 

My second overloaded method in the Library class was also to the Constructor, assuming that the number of floors is 2 and that it has an elevator.

My first overloaded method in the Cafe class is to the sellCoffee() method. I made it possible to only input the size, but there's a default amount of cream and sugar that every coffee gets, regardless of size. I did this for ease, so that only the people that care to specify will have to give cream and sugar as input, but the barista still knows what to do if someone doesn't specify. 

My second overloaded method in the Cafe class was to the Constructor, allowing the input to not specify the number of floors, assuming that there is only 1 floor, as is typical for most cafes.

My first overloaded method in the House class was to the Constructor, allowing the input to exclude whether or not there is an elevator. Though it is not accurate to Smith campus in general, it assumes that the house has elevator if the number of floors is > 1.

My second overloaded method in the House class is also to the Constructor, assuming there is no dining room if not specified and that the house has an elevator if the number of floors is > 1.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Starting early, as always, helps a lot. Even if by starting, you're just forking the repo and reading the README to start getting familiar with the assignment and start thinking about it. Going to office hours is also really helpful. Reading the rubric before the night it's due is also helpful, because sometimes all of the requirements aren't clear just from the README. I would encourage future students to open the assignment early and to go to office hours.
