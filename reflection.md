- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

I overloaded the Library constructor with an option to include the boolean for whether there's an elevator or not to include that in the input. This way, if it was not specified, we assumed that the library had an elevator. I did this because I'm operating in a world where elevator access is assumed. 

I also overloaded sellCoffee() in the Cafe class. I made it possible to only input the size, but there's a default amount of cream and sugar that every coffee gets, regardless of size. I did this for ease, so that only the people that care to specify will have to give cream and sugar as input, but the barista still knows what to do if someone doesn't specify. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
